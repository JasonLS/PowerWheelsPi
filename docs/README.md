Background: We are a group of Highschool students who are intreasted and learning the process of autonomous vehicle design. Over the years we have learned the logic and the process that it takes for an autonomous car to function. We have decided to implement these functions on a small scale using a power wheels kit where the computer driving the car is a Raspberry Pi. We have competed for 3 years with our autonomous car against other schools and won the 2017 Square One trophy and Professionalism trophy aswell. We as a club are only one branch of the total "R.E.S.T" club. REST standing for Roseville Engineering, Science and Technology, our hometowns's club

We are open to any and all questions, advice and critiques.
